[00:00.00] (Le-le-le-let's go!)
[00:10.00] 
[00:14.01] Wake up at 7 o'clock, just how it's s'posed to be
[00:16.75] And keep a radiant smile so the others see
[00:19.61] Work on a regular pace when someone tells you to
[00:22.25] Can't you obey, what is so wrong with you?
[00:24.74] Why can't I be like them? I have tried to befriend them
[00:27.73] I feel like it's nature that drives me away from your designs
[00:31.06] What you like, what you talk, what you strive
[00:33.09] I can't imagine being like you
[00:48.09] 
[00:35.77] I don't believe in your Bible, repeat all your cycles, yeah
[00:39.16] The way you live is only causing me pain
[00:41.32] Your life's so dull, I could never, but claim you know better
[00:44.47] Why am I the one that's getting punished for it? (Ah)
[00:46.92] I am divergent, creative, come give it a try
[00:49.78] If I told you how to behave, you'd know the suffering of mine
[00:52.57] I don't believe you are better, no spirit, no ember, but
[00:55.96] You surely know making my life into hell
[01:15.96] 
[01:09.80] I take a moment to see what you all speak about
[01:12.58] But every time there's a smile, you just creep me out
[01:15.41] I don't condone in these styles, but keep it to myself
[01:18.17] And I don't need any form of your help
[01:37.17] 
[01:20.59] Why can't I live in peace? You just dig underneath
[01:23.29] I can't go on, my life, without hearing my fault in my designs
[01:26.76] What I like, what I talk, what I strive
[01:28.96] I can't be little different from you?
[01:47.46] 
[01:31.48] I don't believe in your Bible, repeat all your cycles, yeah
[01:35.02] The way you live is only causing me pain
[01:37.19] Your life's so dull, I could never, but claim you know better
[01:40.24] Why am I the one that's getting punished for it? (Ah)
[01:42.70] I am divergent, creative, come give it a try
[01:45.48] If I told you how to behave, you'd know the suffering of mine
[01:48.34] I don't believe you are better, no spirit, no ember, but
[01:51.72] You surely know making my life into hell
[02:11.72] 
[02:05.55] Oh, I'm so different, oh-oh, I'm so different
[02:10.82] Oh-oh, I'm so different, oh-oh, I'm so different
[02:34.82] 
[02:16.24] I don't believe in your Bible, repeat all your cycles, yeah
[02:19.63] The way you live is only causing me pain
[02:21.79] Your life's so dull, I could never, but claim you know better
[02:24.90] Why am I the one that's getting punished for it? (Ah)
[02:27.34] I am divergent, creative, come give it a try
[02:30.26] If I told you how to behave, you'd know the suffering of mine
[02:33.02] I don't believe you are better, no spirit, no ember, but
[02:36.46] You surely know making my life into hell
